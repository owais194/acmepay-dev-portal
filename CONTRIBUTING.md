# Contributing

This repository is a portfolio sample, but it uses a lightweight docs-as-code workflow.

## Local editing

- Edit Markdown files under `/docs`
- Keep file names lowercase with hyphens (example: `rate-limits.md`)
- Use relative links

## Style expectations

- Follow [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
- Prefer task-first writing in how-to guides
- Include examples for every API concept (auth, errors, webhooks)

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused (one topic per PR)
- Use the PR template checklist
